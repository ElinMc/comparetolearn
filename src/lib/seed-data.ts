The war is bad. It's really muddy here and I don't like it. We have to stay in trenches which are like big holes in the ground. It rains a lot and my feet are wet.

This war is different because we use guns now instead of swords. Also there are tanks which are new. The Germans started the war because they wanted to take over countries. 

I hope the war ends soon because I want to come home and see everyone. The food here is not very good and I miss your cooking mum. Tell everyone I said hello.

I have to go now because we might have to fight soon. I hope I don't die.

Love from your son`

I am writing to tell you about life in the trenches. It is very difficult here. The trenches are long ditches that we live in. They are very dirty and there is lots of mud everywhere. Sometimes we see rats running around.

This war is not like the old wars. In the old days soldiers used to fight face to face with swords. Now we have machine guns that can kill many people very quickly. We also have artillery shells that explode and make big holes in the ground.

I think we are fighting because Germany invaded Belgium. Britain had to help Belgium because of an agreement. Also the Archduke got shot which started everything off.

The conditions are not good. We don't get much sleep and the noise from the guns is very loud. I miss home very much and think about you all the time.

Please write back soon.

Your loving son`

I hope this letter finds you well. I wanted to write and tell you about what it's like out here on the Western Front. It's nothing like what I expected when I signed up.

The trenches stretch for miles in both directions. We live in these muddy ditches day and night, always watching for the enemy across No Man's Land. The conditions are grim - there's standing water at the bottom of the trench most days, and we've all got trench foot from the damp. Rats are everywhere, big ones too, feeding on things I'd rather not mention.

This war is completely different from any before it. My grandfather told me about wars where armies would line up and fight proper battles that were over in a day. Here, we've been stuck in the same spot for months. The machine guns make it impossible to advance - anyone who goes over the top gets cut down before they've gone twenty yards.

The Germans aren't really so different from us, I think. This all started because of alliances and empires wanting more power. Now millions of us are stuck here fighting because the politicians couldn't sort it out.

I try to stay positive but it's hard. Write soon.

Your son`

I write to you from somewhere in France, though I cannot say exactly where. The censors would black it out anyway. What I can tell you is that life in the trenches is unlike anything I could have imagined when I enlisted with such enthusiasm last year.

The trenches themselves are a marvel of misery. Wooden duckboards line the bottom, but they're often submerged in foul water mixed with mud. The walls are reinforced with sandbags, and we've carved out little dugouts where we try to sleep between our watches. The smell is something awful - a mixture of unwashed men, cordite, and worse things I shan't describe. The rats have grown bold, scurrying over us at night.

This is warfare transformed beyond recognition. Previous generations spoke of cavalry charges and battles won in an afternoon. Here, we face machine guns that can fire 600 rounds per minute, artillery that can obliterate entire sections of trench, and poison gas that burns the lungs. No amount of courage can overcome such weapons - we learnt that at the Somme.

As for why we fight - I confess the reasons seem murkier the longer I'm here. Something about Belgian neutrality, German aggression, the assassination of an Archduke. Great powers drew their swords because of treaties signed decades ago. And here we are, paying the price.

I remain in good spirits, though I miss you terribly. 

Your devoted son`

Another week has passed in this purgatory of mud and wire, and I find myself with a quiet moment to write. The artillery has fallen silent for now, though we all know it's merely gathering breath.

Allow me to paint you a picture of our existence here. We occupy a trench perhaps seven feet deep, zigzagging across the landscape to prevent enemy fire from sweeping its entire length. Ahead lies No Man's Land - a wasteland of craters, tangled barbed wire, and sights I dare not describe. Behind us, communication trenches lead to support lines and eventually to the rear. We rotate between front line, support, and rest, though "rest" is a generous term.

The conditions test us daily. Trench foot claims men as surely as German bullets - our feet never truly dry. We share our quarters with rats the size of cats, grown fat on horrors. Lice infest every seam of clothing. And the constant thunder of the guns frays the nerves of even the steadiest men.

Father, you spoke of wars of movement, of cavalry and honour. That world has vanished. The machine gun has seen to that. At the Somme, we watched wave after wave of good men walk into a wall of lead. The generals still haven't grasped that courage alone cannot defeat modern firepower. We dig, we hold, we die - and the line moves yards, not miles.

Why do we fight? The newspapers speak of defending civilisation, of Belgian atrocities, of the Kaiser's ambitions. Perhaps there's truth in it. But out here, we fight for the men beside us and for the hope of home.

With all my love,
Your son`

The guns have fallen quiet this evening, and by the light of a single candle stub, I take pen in hand to write to you. I wonder sometimes if my letters convey anything true about this place, or if the reality is simply beyond words.

We have been in the front line trenches for six days now. The system is elaborate - fire trenches at the front with parapets for shooting, communication trenches running back like veins, support trenches where reserves wait, and further back still, the artillery positions that make the earth shake day and night. The engineering would impress you, Father, though the purpose would not.

The conditions remain what they have been: grim. We stand in mud that sucks at our boots and never dries. Trench foot has taken more of our company than German shells this month. The rats have grown so numerous and bold that they'll take food from a sleeping man's hand. And the smell - that sickly-sweet odour that hangs over No Man's Land - I fear it will never leave my memory.

I have been thinking much about how this war differs from those you read to me about as a boy. You spoke of Waterloo, of formations and flags and battles decided in a day. This is something altogether different. The machine gun has made such warfare impossible. When we attacked last month, we went over the top into a storm of lead that no human courage could withstand. Industrial warfare, they call it. The factories produce the shells, the machine guns, the barbed wire - and we feed ourselves into their maw.

As to why we fight - the question grows harder to answer the longer we're here. Austria demanded too much of Serbia, Russia mobilised, Germany invaded Belgium, and treaty-bound Britain joined. Now millions of young men sit in holes pointing rifles at each other. I believe we must defeat German militarism, but I wonder if the cost will leave anything worth saving.

I think of home constantly. Kiss little Sarah for me.

Ever your loving son`

I write to you from our dugout, a hollowed space in the trench wall perhaps eight feet deep, roofed with timber and corrugated iron and a foot of earth that we pray will stop anything but a direct hit. By the guttering light of a candle, with the rumble of distant artillery as my companion, I shall try to tell you something of this world.

We have been on the Western Front for four months now, though time moves strangely here. Our existence follows a rigid pattern: stand-to at dawn, when attacks are most likely; the daily round of sentry duty, trench repair, and working parties; stand-to again at dusk; then the night, when patrols venture into No Man's Land and ration parties brave the communication trenches. Sleep is stolen in fragments.

The physical conditions would beggar your imagination. Trench foot is endemic despite our precautions - our feet never truly dry. The rats are beyond nightmare - fat, fearless creatures that will gnaw at a sleeping man. Body lice colonise every seam of our clothing within hours of delousing. Above all hangs the smell: cordite, chloride of lime, unwashed bodies, and that other sweetish odour from No Man's Land that haunts us all.

Father, I know you have read of the wars of Wellington and Napoleon, of cavalry charges and infantry squares. Such warfare has become impossible. The magazine rifle, the machine gun, and quick-firing artillery have created a wall of fire that no amount of courage can breach. At Loos, I watched a battalion of Kitchener's volunteers walk into German fire as if on parade, keeping formation as they were systematically destroyed. At the Somme, fresh volunteers from Kitchener's armies walked toward the German wire - in many places uncut despite the week-long bombardment - and died in windrows. The tactics of 1914 met the technology of 1916, and 60,000 men fell in a single day.

This is industrial war, Father. The factories of Birmingham and Essen are as vital as any regiment. Shells are produced by the million, wire by the ton, men by the conscript's lot. We are fed into a machine that grinds us down on both sides.

The question of why we fight grows more complex the longer I am here. The proximate cause is clear enough: Germany violated Belgian neutrality, activating our treaty obligations. But the deeper causes reach back decades. The shots at Sarajevo merely lit a fuse that had been laid across the entire continent.

I remain your loving son, though I wonder if the boy who left England still exists.

Ever yours`

The Verey lights are rising over No Man's Land as I write, casting their ghostly illumination across a landscape that would not be out of place in Dante's vision of Hell. I find myself with a moment's peace and an urgent need to set down something true about this place, even knowing that half of it will not survive the censor's pen.

We are dug into the Flanders plain, part of a trench system that stretches from the Belgian coast to the Swiss border - some 400 miles of parallel scars across the face of Europe. Our particular section is a warren of fire trenches, support trenches, communication trenches, and saps, all connected in a maze that new men take weeks to learn. The engineering is remarkable: fire steps for shooting, traverses to limit blast damage, sump holes for drainage that never quite works, and revetments of sandbags, timber, and corrugated iron holding back the perpetually collapsing walls.

The conditions would test the fortitude of Job himself. We stand in mud that varies from ankle-deep to thigh-deep depending on the weather and the state of the duckboards. Trench foot claims men daily - feet swelling, turning gangrenous, sometimes requiring amputation. The battalion medical officer inspects our feet regularly, and we rub whale oil into them when we can get it, but it's a losing battle. The rats are constant companions, grown bold and fat beyond nightmares. And the lice - we spend every spare moment "chatting," but they breed faster than we can kill them.

Father, you taught me to revere the military history of our nation - Waterloo, Balaclava, the march to Kandahar. Those wars, for all their horror, had a grammar we could understand: manoeuvre, position, decisive engagement. This war has made such thinking obsolete. The machine gun has done what Napoleon's artillery could not - it has pinned armies in place. When we attack, we must cross perhaps 500 yards of open ground against weapons that fire ten rounds per second. The mathematics are merciless. At the Somme, on that first day in July, we lost 60,000 men. Sixty thousand in a single day, Mother, and the line moved barely at all.

The weapons are products of our industrial age: the Maxim gun, the howitzer, the mortar, poison gas that burns the lungs and blinds the eyes. And now the tank, which we pray might finally break the deadlock. This is factory warfare - shells produced by the millions in Sheffield and the Ruhr, rifles standardised, men conscripted and processed and fed into the line. Kitchener's volunteers came singing patriotic songs; they have learned different tunes.

Why do we fight? I believe these things, still. But I also know that we are all trapped now - British, French, German alike - in a catastrophe none of us can stop.

I remain, with all my heart,
Your loving son`

It is past midnight, and I am writing by the light of a single candle in our company dugout, some twenty feet beneath the tortured surface of Flanders. Above us, the German artillery maintains its irregular harassment fire - we have learned to distinguish the different calibres by their sound, the whizz-bangs from the five-nines, the crash of the heavies from the sharper crack of field guns. One learns such things here, or one does not survive to learn anything.

I have been on the Western Front for seven months now, and I feel I should try to convey something true about this existence, knowing that my earlier letters must have seemed either falsely cheerful or incomprehensibly grim. The truth lies somewhere in between, or perhaps encompasses both.

Our position is part of the vast trench system that scars this landscape from the Channel to Switzerland. The engineering commands a certain respect: the traversed fire trenches that prevent enfilade fire, the deep dugouts where we shelter from bombardment, the elaborate drainage systems that almost manage to keep us above water. We rotate through the system - four days in the front line, four in support, four in reserve.

The physical conditions remain extreme. Trench foot is endemic despite our precautions - we have lost more men to it than to enemy action this month. The clay of Flanders holds water like a sponge. The rats are ubiquitous, grown fat and fearless; we have given up trying to eradicate them. Body lice colonise every seam of our clothing within hours of delousing. Above all hangs the smell: cordite, chloride of lime, unwashed bodies, and the sickly-sweet odour from No Man's Land.

Father, you raised me on tales of Waterloo and the Crimea, of cavalry charges and thin red lines. Such warfare has been made impossible. The machine gun has created a wall of fire that no amount of courage can breach. At Loos, I watched the 15th Scottish Division advance into German fire as if on parade. They were scythed down like wheat. At the Somme, fresh volunteers from Kitchener's armies walked toward the German wire - in many places uncut despite the week-long bombardment - and died in windrows. The tactics of 1914 met the technology of 1916, and 60,000 men fell in a single day.

This is industrial warfare, waged by industrial nations. The shell crisis of last year taught us that this war would be won in the factories as much as the trenches. We have industrialised slaughter.

The question of why we fight grows more complex the longer I am here. Germany violated Belgian neutrality; Britain was bound by treaty; the balance of power hung in the balance. But we are all trapped now in a catastrophe none of us can stop. The old world is dying in these trenches.

I think of home constantly - of your garden, Mother, of Father's study, of Sunday roasts. These images sustain me.

I remain, with all my heart,
Your loving son`

    content: `My Dearest Mother and Father,

I am writing from our battalion headquarters, a reinforced cellar beneath the ruins of what was once a prosperous farmhouse. The guns have fallen unusually quiet this evening, and I find myself with a precious hour and an overwhelming need to set down something honest about this place and this war.

I have now been on the Western Front for nine months. In that time I have seen things I could never have imagined, and I have come to understand this conflict in ways that no newspaper report could convey.

Our trench system stretches from Nieuport on the Belgian coast to Pfetterhouse on the Swiss border - some 440 miles of continuous fortification. The front line comprises fire trenches, with their fire steps and traverses; support trenches some 70 to 100 yards back; reserve trenches further still; and the whole connected by a web of communication trenches, saps, and tunnels. The Germans, who have held their ground since 1914, have developed this defensive architecture even further - their dugouts are sometimes 40 feet deep, impervious to all but the heaviest shells, furnished with electric lighting and ventilation.

The conditions of daily existence are difficult to convey. We live in intimate acquaintance with mud - Flanders clay that clings, sucks, and drowns. Men have disappeared into shell holes filled with liquid mud, swallowed before their comrades could reach them. Trench foot is endemic; we inspect our feet twice daily, rub whale oil into them, change our socks religiously, and still the casualty stations fill. The rats are beyond nightmare - brown, sleek creatures the size of cats, grown bold on a diet I prefer not to contemplate. Lice infest us all, breeding faster than we can kill them. And over everything lies that smell: cordite, chloride of lime, putrescence, the sour stench of fear, and the sweetish odour of death.

Father, you taught me military history from an early age. I grew up on accounts of Waterloo, of the Light Brigade, of Gordon at Khartoum. Those wars followed a comprehensible grammar: manoeuvre, decisive engagement, victory or defeat. This war is something altogether different. The technologies of the industrial age have created conditions in which offensive action is nearly impossible. A single machine gun, properly sited, can hold a battalion. The defensive has become supreme.

We have sought ways to break this deadlock. Artillery bombardment was supposed to destroy the enemy positions - at the Somme, we fired 1.5 million shells in a week. But the deep dugouts sheltered the German machine gunners. Gas offered hope, but both sides now have masks. The tank is slow and unreliable. The war of movement has become a war of attrition, grinding away the youth of Europe month by month.

This is industrial warfare, reshaping not just tactics but society itself. The shell crisis taught Britain that modern war consumes material at rates peacetime industry cannot supply. We are all becoming war states.

As for the causes - the immediate trigger was Austria-Hungary's ultimatum to Serbia. But the deeper causes reach back through decades: the alliance systems, the arms races, the imperial rivalries, the nationalism that persuaded millions of young men to march singing to their deaths.

And yet Germany's violation of Belgian neutrality was real. The atrocities in Belgium were real. Prussian militarism, with its cult of war and its belief that might makes right, must be defeated. If we stop now, our children will have to fight this war again.

I think of home constantly. The specific memories sustain me: the smell of Mother's garden in summer, the sound of church bells on Sunday morning, Father reading by the fire. These are what I am fighting for.

I remain, now and always, your loving son

P.S. - Tell little Thomas that I found a French coin for his collection. I shall bring it when I come home on leave - if the fates allow.`
